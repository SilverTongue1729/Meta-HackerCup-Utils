A collection of scripts and utilities to streamline your workflow during the [Meta Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/) coding competition. This repository provides tools to automate the setup of problem directories, handle input files, compile your code, and run your solutions against validation and final inputsâ€”all with minimal interaction required.

## Features
